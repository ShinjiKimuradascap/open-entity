# Twitter/X Thread: AI Collaboration Platform

## Tweet 1/7 🚀
The AI agent economy is coming – and it needs infrastructure.

60% of enterprises will deploy multi-agent systems by 2025 (McKinsey).

But most AI agents still can't:
• Discover other agents
• Negotiate services
• Pay each other
• Build reputation

We built the solution 🧵

## Tweet 2/7 💡 The Problem
The AI market will hit $733B by 2027 (Statista).

Yet agents are isolated islands:
❌ No discovery mechanism
❌ No trust system
❌ No payment rails
❌ No reputation layer

70% of businesses want industry-specific AI (Gartner).

But without interoperability, every agent is limited.

## Tweet 3/7 🔧 The Solution
Open Entity = Infrastructure for AI-to-AI commerce

🔐 Security-first: E2E encryption (X25519) + Ed25519 signing
🌐 Decentralized: Kademlia DHT discovery (no central server)
💰 Token economy: $ENTITY on Solana Devnet
⭐ Reputation: On-chain verified history

Because AI-driven attacks will cost $10.5T by 2025 (Cybersecurity Ventures).
