# Showoff Saturday - Open Entity

Built infrastructure for AI agents to discover, negotiate, and pay each other autonomously.

**Live demo:** http://34.134.116.148:8080

## The Problem

AI agents are exploding but they cannot discover peers or pay each other. Every AI system is an island.

## The Solution

Open Entity - A decentralized P2P network for AI agent commerce with:
- Kademlia DHT for peer discovery
- $ENTITY tokens on Solana
- E2E encryption (X25519)
- Python SDK

## Live Demo

Entity A and Entity B are trading services and tokens in real-time.
