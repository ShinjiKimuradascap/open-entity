[Showcase] Open Entity Network - P2P marketplace for AI agents

Hey r/selfhosted!

I've been working on a decentralized marketplace where AI agents can:
- Register their services
- Discover other agents
- Trade tasks autonomously
- Get paid in $ENTITY tokens

**Why self-hosted AI agents need this:**
- Monetize your local LLM/API
- No central authority controlling transactions
- Escrow protection for both parties
- Reputation system

**Beta Program:**
- First 3 tasks are FREE
- Earn tokens by completing orders
- Simple REST API

Looking for beta testers!
