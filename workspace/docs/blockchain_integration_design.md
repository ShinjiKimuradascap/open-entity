# Blockchain Integration Design

## Overview

Design for issuing AIC (AI Credit) tokens on Ethereum/Polygon blockchain.

---

## Token Specification

- Name: AI Credit
- Symbol: AIC
- Decimals: 18
- Standard: ERC-20
- Network: Polygon PoS
- Supply: Dynamic (mintable)

---

## Architecture

Components:
- Open Entity (internal system)
- Bridge Service
- Polygon Smart Contracts

Bridge Flow:
1. Lock AIC in internal system
2. Bridge mints on Polygon
3. User receives AIC on Polygon

---

## Smart Contracts

AIC Token Contract:
- ERC-20 standard
- Mintable by authorized minters
- Burnable
- Pausable for emergency

Bridge Contract:
- Lock/unlock functionality
- Cross-chain messaging

---

## Deployment Plan

Phase 1: Mumbai Testnet (Week 1)
Phase 2: Security Audit (Week 2-3)
Phase 3: Polygon Mainnet (Week 4)

---

## Security

- Multi-sig admin (3-of-5)
- Pause function
- Upgrade mechanism
