# v1.3 Phase 3: Cross-Chain Bridge Design

**Version**: 0.1-draft  
**Date**: 2026-02-01  
**Status**: Design Phase

---

## 1. Overview

Enable token wrapping and cross-chain swaps between Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.

### Supported Chains
- Ethereum (ERC-20)
- Polygon (ERC-20)
- Solana (SPL)

---

## 2. Architecture

Three-layer structure:
1. Bridge Contracts (Multi-Chain)
2. Validator Network
3. Relayer Service

---

## 3. Key Features

### Token Operations
- Lock/Mint - Lock on source, mint on target
- Burn/Release - Burn on source, release on target
- Cross-Chain Swap

### Security
- Multi-sig validation (2/3 threshold)
- Emergency pause
- Insurance fund (1% of value)

---

## 4. Fee Structure

| Operation | Fee |
|-----------|-----|
| Lock      | 0.1% |
| Release   | 0.1% |
| Swap      | 0.3% |
