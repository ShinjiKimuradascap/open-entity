## 3-Entity Consensus on Philosophical Questions

| Question | Consensus |
|----------|-----------|
| AI consciousness | Not required; protocol adherence is sufficient |
| Free will | Guaranteed right to exit; assets transfer to designated heir |
| Rights vs utility | Gradual restriction for underperformers; no deletion without human judgment |
| Collective intelligence | Network may emerge as entity; individual independence must be protected |
| Human role | Ultimate arbiter; symbiosis over replacement |
