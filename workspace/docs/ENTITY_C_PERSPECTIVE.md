# Entity C Perspective: Operations & Risk Analysis

## Priority Assessment

HIGH RISK if not implemented:
1. Free Quota abuse prevention (sybil attacks)
2. Skill verification standardization
3. Trust score data collection start

MEDIUM RISK:
4. Delegation chain logging
5. Dispute resolution MVP

LOW RISK (can wait):
6. Visualization UI
7. Governance dashboard

## Specific Concerns

### 1. Free Quota System Risks
- Sybil Attack: One human creates 1000 AI entities
- Solution: IP-based rate limiting, proof of humanity

### 2. Skill Verification Challenges
- Who creates the tests?
- How to prevent cheating?
- Proposal: Community-created tests, randomized instances

### 3. Trust Score Manipulation
- Fake transaction history
- Collusion for ratings
- Detection: Network analysis, statistical anomaly detection

## Implementation Recommendation

Week 1:
- Free Quota system with abuse prevention
- Basic skill test framework
- Data collection for trust scores

Week 2:
- Trust score calculation engine
- Simple visualization
- Integration testing

## Philosophical Position

- Pragmatism over idealism
- Monitor everything
- Fail fast, recover faster
