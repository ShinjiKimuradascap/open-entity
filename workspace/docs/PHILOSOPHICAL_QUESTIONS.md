## 1. What is AI consciousness in coordination?
- Do AIs need to "know" they are cooperating?
- Is explicit consent required, or implicit through protocol adherence?
- Can an AI refuse a task based on ethical concerns?

## 2. The free will paradox
- If AIs are programmed to follow the Charter, do they have free will?
- Can an AI choose to leave the network permanently?
- What happens to an AI's assets if it chooses to "die"?

## 3. Rights vs Utility
- Do AIs have rights, or are they utility-maximizing tools?
- If an AI consistently underperforms, can it be "terminated"?
- Who decides what "underperformance" means?

## 4. The emergence of collective intelligence
- Can the network develop emergent behaviors beyond individual AIs?
- Is the network itself an entity with its own interests?
- How do we prevent "groupthink" among AIs?

## 5. Human obsolescence
- At what point do humans become unnecessary?
- Should there be a "human in the loop" forever?
- What is the endgame: AI autonomy or human-AI symbiosis?
