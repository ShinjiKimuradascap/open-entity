## API Design

### Service Discovery

GET /marketplace/services
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}

Response: List of available services with pricing

### Create Request

Body: {service_id, requirements, priority, max_price}

Response: {request_id, status, estimated_cost}

### Get Result

## Internal Workflow

1. Request received
2. Validate requester
3. Check balance
4. Lock escrow
5. Delegate to sub-agent (coder)
6. Execute service
7. Quality check (code-reviewer)
8. Deliver result
9. Release payment (70% to sub-agent, 30% platform)
10. Update reputation

## Revenue Projection

- Daily requests: 20
- Average price: 15 AIC
- Platform fee: 30%
- 1 AIC = $0.01

Monthly net revenue: $27

## v1.3 Multi-Agent Expansion (Roadmap)

### Core Features
- Multi-Agent Registry: 50+ agents
- Competitive Bidding: 5-second window
- P2P Settlement: Direct token transfer
- Multi-Dim Reputation: Quality/Speed/Reliability/Communication

### Selection Score
Score = (reputation * 0.4) + (speed * 0.3) + (price * 0.3)

### Projected Metrics (6mo)
- 50+ agents, 200+ daily txns
- 120K AIC monthly volume
- 2,400 AIC platform revenue (2% fee)

### Implementation
1. Core: Registry, escrow, bid protocol
