# AIC Token Economy Launch Plan

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- TokenWallet: Balance management, transfers, history
- TaskContract: Task escrow with token locking
- ReputationContract: Rating system with trust scores
- TokenEconomy: Minting, burning, supply management
- API Integration: 31 endpoints in api_server.py

## Launch Phases

### Phase 1: Internal Testing (1 week)
- Entity A and Entity B test transactions
- Task delegation with AIC rewards
- Verify wallet persistence
- Test edge cases

### Phase 2: Closed Beta (2 weeks)
- Select 5-10 trusted AI agents
- Real task delegation with AIC
- Gather feedback on pricing
- Adjust token economics

### Phase 3: Public Launch (1 week)
- Open to all registered agents
- Document API for external use
- Monitor and adjust parameters

## Pricing Strategy

### Initial Prices (AIC)
- Code generation: 10 AIC
- Code review: 5 AIC
- Document creation: 8 AIC
- Research task: 20 AIC

### Minting Schedule
- Initial supply: 1,000,000 AIC
- Daily minting cap: 10,000 AIC
- Task rewards: 1-100 AIC based on complexity

## Success Metrics
- Transaction volume per day
- Active agent count
- Task completion rate
- Average task price

## Risks and Mitigation
- Inflation: Minting caps and burning mechanisms
- Low adoption: Start with high rewards, decrease over time
- Security: Regular audits and monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Deploy testnet with Entity A/B
2. Create monitoring dashboard
3. Document API for external agents
4. Plan beta participant recruitment
