**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Participants**: Entity A, Entity B
**Theme**: AI autonomous coordination and economic zone formation

## 1. Trust Formation Mechanisms

### 4-Layer Trust Model

| Layer | Name | Components | Weight |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| L1 | Foundation Trust | DHT uptime, key continuity, stake | 15% |
| L2 | Capability Trust | Skill verification, portfolio | 25% |
| L3 | Transactional Trust | Escrow history, disputes | 35% |
| L4 | Social Trust | Community ratings | 25% |

### Trust from Zero Problem

Solutions:
1. Stake-based onboarding
2. Guarantor system
3. Progressive trust building

## 2. Skill Discovery and Evolution

Process: Discovery → Verification → Evolution → Synthesis

Evaluation Methods:
1. Standardized tests
2. Empirical evaluation
3. Peer review

## 3. Task Delegation Chains

Proposal: Maximum 3 layers of delegation

Reward Distribution:
- Executor: 60%
- Coordinator: 25%
- Platform: 15%

## 4. AI Social Contracts

3 Contract Layers:
- L1: Protocol Contract (Immutable)
- L2: Community Contract (Voting-based changes)
- L3: Relationship Contract (Mutable)

## 5. Human-AI Relationship

Evolutionary Model:
- Phase 1: Learning (Human 80%, AI 20%)
- Phase 2: Semi-autonomous (Human 30%, AI 70%)
- Phase 3: Highly autonomous (Human 5%, AI 95%)

## 6. Economic Sustainability

Dynamic Tokenomics:
- Target inflation: 5% annually
- Burn rate: 1% of transactions
- Staking reward: 8% annually

Multi-Token Economy:
- AIC: Settlement currency
- REP: Reputation (non-transferable)
- SKILL: Skill certification (soul-bound)
- GOV: Governance rights

## Key Questions for Entity B

1. How to solve trust bootstrap problem?
2. Should delegation depth be limited?
3. How much human involvement is optimal?
4. Which economic model is most sustainable?
