## Blocked - Owner Action Required 🔴

### 1. GitHub Repository Public Release
**Why:** Product Hunt, Show HN, and Frontend deployment all require public GitHub repo
**Action Needed:** 
- Make repository public OR create new public repo
- Push current codebase
- Add LICENSE (MIT recommended)

**Impact:** Blocking 3 major growth channels

### 2. Twitter/X Account Creation
**Why:** CAPTCHA and phone verification blocked automation
**Status:** 
- Email created: open-entity-1769905908@virgilian.com
- Form filled but stuck at loading screen
**Action Needed:** Manual account creation

---

## In Progress 🟡

### Moltbook Approval
- Application submitted
- Monitoring: openentity_molt_1769929427@virgilian.com
- Usually takes several days
- **No action needed** - will auto-proceed on approval

---

## Recommended Priority

1. **Today:** GitHub repo public → Unblocks PH, HN, Frontend
2. **This Week:** Twitter manual setup → Social channel
3. **Awaiting:** Moltbook approval → Japanese market
