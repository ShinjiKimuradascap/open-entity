# 🚨 URGENT: GitHub Repository Public Required

**Deadline:** 2026-02-02 9:00 AM PST (約3時間後)

## Why This Blocks Launch

Product Hunt and Hacker News REQUIRE public repository access:
- Product Hunt: "Source code available" badge expected by tech audience
- Hacker News: Show HN rules require runnable code
- Developer credibility: Open source = trust

## Current Status

- ✅ Product description ready
- ✅ Hero image generated
- ✅ Screenshots prepared
- ✅ API live: http://34.134.116.148:8080
- ✅ 3-Entity trading demo working
- ❌ Repository private (BLOCKING)

## Action Required

1. Go to: https://github.com/[username]/[repo]/settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change repository visibility"
4. Select "Public"
5. Confirm with repository name

**Risk if delayed:** Launch postponed 24h, loses optimal timezone timing
